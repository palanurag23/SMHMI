|Ticket number| Description                                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SMA-1049    | Music player volume doesn't remain the same after exiting demo        |
| SMA-1115    | Cannot delete via shell console user with special chars in his name   |
| SMA-1096    | Very rare the CM4 core is blocked in IRQ waiting for I2C rcv          |
| SMA-1000    | OK/Palm gesture reaction seems mismatched in single gesture           |
| SMA-1007    | Keyboard doesn’t work smoothly                                        |

**Known Limitation:**

1. Audio commands that sounds alike might be wrongly detected.
2. Gesture recognition depends on camera orientation. Under some angles, the Ok gesture looks like palm
3. IR camera flicker. The application uses the IR camera over an emulated [flexio-CSI interface](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN12686.pdf). This interface uses the generic DMA which has lower priority for memory access and shouldn't be used for resolution greater than QVGA. In our application the IR camera has VGA resolution. In addition to that the Smart-HMI EVK has only one SDRAM connected over 16 lines. In order to support the resolution mentioned, we had to reduce the memory access for SDRAM. To do that, the display framerate has been reduced to 30fsp from 60fps. Other workarounds to reduce the 'stress' over SDRAM interface is to reduce the CSI camera resolution, reduce Flexio camera resolution, reduce display resolution, reduce framerate, use internal TCM memory to store the display buffer. From our tests, the best version is to reduce display resolution to 30fsp.

**V1.1.2**

**Improvements**

1. Upgrade oasis library to v2.2.0 which integrated the fix for the multiple registration issue while the face has partial brightness.
2. Upgrade the VoiceSeeker to v0.6.0.
3. Upgrade the VIT to V4.7.7 RFP release.
4. Upgrade the DSMT coffee machine and elevator Chinese voice model to version 6.
5. Move flexspi clock to pll2 pfd2 to improve the system performance.
6. For MCUXpresso IDE 11.7.0 or newer the "Manage linker script" is usable again.
7. GUI in bootloader to enhance user experience for MSD updates.

**Bug Fix**

1. MSD is not working properly when DLP software are running on host.

**Known Limitation:**

1. Depending on the type of DLP software installed on the computer, the MSD might not be usable at all. In this case the workaround is to use the serial download mode combined with Ivaldi or McuBootUtility or other compatible tool.

**V1.1.1**

**HotFix**

1. Fix database backward compatibility when doing update without a prior mass erase.

**V1.1.0**

**What’s new**

1. Added elevator demo application
2. New camera support MIPI - GC2145
3. Increase flash size to 64MB in order to support 2 applications
4. NXP VIT library for voice recognition capabilities (en/de/cn)
5. Multilingual wake word and prompt responds (only for Cybron, DSMT)
6. Barge-in feature
7. Audio Dump feature for offline audio validation
8. Ivaldi support for mass production flashing
9. On Screen face information for easier debugging
10. Coffee machine:

    * Enable WiFi
    * Over the air update via Amazon cloud

11. Image validation in bootloader (disable by default)

**Bug Fix**
1. Memory leak in framework
2. LCD flicker when wake up
3. Database lacks backward compatibility after update. Affects both coffee machine demo and elevator demo.


**Improvements**

1. Improve UI/touch responsiveness
2. Voice recognition accuracy and precision
3. Face recognition accuracy
4. Improve bootup time (from bootloader to first video frame)
5. Change audio prompts for better quality
